Conways Game of Life
---

Tech wise this is a Node.js application that uses Express.js and is essentially powered by jQuery (it's doing most of the business logic). Look in public/js/client.js for the crux of it.

You can read the [insightful wikipedia page] but basically this demonstrates the idea of chaos theory.

Chaos theory stripped down says something like.. 'for very small changes in the initial conditions for a system, extremely different behaviour / characteristics / output may be observed'.

For example, the weather on Earth is chaotic. You can generally predict where cloud formations and clusters will go and how they will interact or collide with others (with huge computational power) but for all the zillions of particles that are flying at each other, you can't say for sure and besides (this is what's really chaotic about it) two seemingly very similar situations may in fact end very differently like... 5 hours later... because a tiny gust of hot air here or there then caused a chain reaction that caused another blah blah blah....

The point of Conway's game of life is to show that with 4 simple rules, you can create a kind of ecosystem (and this is how populations of animals work) whereby small differences in two initial setups can mean that the game plays out wildly differently.

Enjoy
